Q.6  What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them?


Ans - 

Template literal is a new way of writing string template along with placeholder for variables.

To use them we just remove the quote sign from the start and end of the string.

let str = "Hello my name is: Pravar"; // Normal way of writing string

let's change it in template literal
let str = `Hello my name is: Pravar`;


if there is a variable that we want to use with a string we have this functionality also using template literals

let name = "Pravar";

let str = `Hello my name is: ${name}`;

console.log(str);    // Output : Hello my name is: Pravar


You have to just add backticks (`) in start and end of string and if you want to use any variable inside template literal then you can inscribe any varibale name inside surly braces started with a dollar sign (${}).
