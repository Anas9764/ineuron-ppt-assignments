Q.2 Explain Temporal Dead Zone?


Ans-

If we are trying to access variable defined with let and const keyword before it's initialization then it will give a Reference Error.
Accessing a variable before it's initialization is also known as temporal dead zone for the variable where it can't be access.




Let's understand with an example:

{
	// The temporal dead zone for variable x has started
	// The temporal dead zone for variable x continues
	Console.log(x); // This will return Reference Error
	
	Let x = "Hello" // The temporal dead zone for variable x ends here
	// After the temporal dead zone ended for the variable x.
	// Now you can access the variable x
	
	Console.log(x) // Works fine
}
