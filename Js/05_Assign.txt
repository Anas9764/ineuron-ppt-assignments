Q.5 What is the difference between let and const ?


Ans-

    Let - 
    The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword. 

    Scope: block scoped: The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It canâ€™t be accessible outside the particular block ({block}).


    Const - 
    The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it.

    Scope: block scoped: When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.
