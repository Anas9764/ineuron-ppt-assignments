Q.7 Whatâ€™s Grid & Flex and difference between them?

Ans:

CSS Grid:
Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create grid structures with rows and columns.

It provides fine-grained control over the placement and alignment of elements within the grid.

Grid allows you to define both the size and position of elements, making it suitable for complex layouts.

Grid is ideal for creating overall page layouts, where elements are placed in relation to each other in a grid-like structure.

CSS Flex:
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that operates along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically).

It is designed to provide flexible and responsive layouts for components within a container.

Flexbox allows you to distribute space, align items, and control their order within a flexible container.

It is particularly useful for building flexible components like navigation bars, lists, and form elements.
